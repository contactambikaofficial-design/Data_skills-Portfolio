# Data Technician Bootcamp – 8 Week Learning Journey
##  Overview

This repository contains projects, exercises, and notes from my 8-week Data Technician Bootcamp. 
The bootcamp focused on building practical data analytics and technical skills — including data cleaning, visualization, SQL querying,Azure cloud and automation using Python.
Each week introduced new tools and hands-on assignments designed to simulate real-world data analysis tasks.
The bootcamp emphasized the analysis of various datasets, including global GDP performance, to derive meaningful data-driven insights.

## Bootcamp Structure
**Duration:** 8 Weeks  
**Focus Areas:**
### Week 1 – Data Fundamentals and Excel for Analysis
Learned the basics of data handling and organization using Microsoft Excel.  
Focused on functions, pivot tables, and basic statistical analysis to summarize and interpret datasets efficiently.
###  Week 2 – Data Visualization using Power BI / Tableau
Explored techniques for visualizing data insights through interactive dashboards.  
Gained experience in connecting data sources, creating charts, and designing reports to communicate business trends effectively.
###  Week 3 – SQL for Data Extraction and Querying
Developed skills to extract, filter, and aggregate data using SQL queries.
